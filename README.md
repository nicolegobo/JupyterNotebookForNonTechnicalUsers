# JupyterNotebookForNonTechnicalUsers

While many more detailed introductions to Juypter Notebooks exist, this is just a breif introduction geared towards someone who would run analyses from an exsisting Juypter Notebook rather than start from scratch.  For example, you maybe a wet lab scientist who is colaborating with a dry lab scientist. 

If you plan to write your own Jupyter Notebooks or would like to take a deeper look here are some helpful resources:

### What can a juypter notebook do?
A Jupyter Notebook is a robust tool yet user friendly tool to get started with if you are new to data science. It is a blend between an integrated development environment(IDE) and an electronic notebook.

According to their [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html):

>*The notebook extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in a qualitatively new direction, providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. The Jupyter notebook combines two components:*
>
>***A web application***: *a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their rich media output.*
>
>***Notebook documents***: *a representation of all content visible in the web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.*

As a browser based tool they are accessible. The notebook structure makes analyses approcable, in a step by step fashion and the results are easily repoducible. 

### When, where and Why would you use Juypter Notebooks?
Jupyter notebooks especially helpful in the following scenarios:
- Showing code to other people
- Running an analysis and show the output in the same place
- Repeating the same analyses with different input the files
- During live demos
